\brief Check whether a set of points on a 3D-grid is inside or outside a surface defined by a polyhedron.
This function uses ray-tracing to determine whether or not a point is inside the surface. Since the points
to be checked are aligned on a grid, we can reuse information for each point to perform the calculation
significantly faster than if we were to check each point individually.
\param inside[out] Boolean array of output values, must be large enough to contain nx*ny*nz values. The result corresponding to the coordinate (x[i], y[j], z[k]) is found
in inside[(j * nx * ny) + (i * ny) +  k]. The reason for this configuration is to align with Matlab's meshgrid(x, y, z) function.
\param vertices[in] Array of vertices in the polyhedron. Each vertex consists of 3 coordinates, x, y and z, therefore this is an n x 3 array.
\param faceIndices[in] Definition of the triangular faces of the surface. Each row of this matrix consists of three indices into the vertex-list, which together define
a triangular face.
\param nFaces Number of faces in the surface (size of faceIndices)
\param x X-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param nx Number of X-coordinates
\param y Y-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param ny Number of Y-coordinates
\param z Z-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param nz Number of Z-coordinates

/**
\brief Check whether a set of points on a 3D-grid is inside or outside a surface defined by a polyhedron.
This function uses ray-tracing to determine whether or not a point is inside the surface. Since the points
to be checked are aligned on a grid, we can reuse information for each point to perform the calculation
significantly faster than if we were to check each point individually.
This function is exactly the same as the other insidePolyhedron function, except that the surface is defined in a single list of triangular faces instead of a separate
list of vertices and faces.
\param inside[out] Boolean array of output values, must be large enough to contain nx*ny*nz values. The result corresponding to the coordinate (x[i], y[j], z[k]) is found
in inside[(j * nx * ny) + (i * ny) +  k]. The reason for this configuration is to align with Matlab's meshgrid(x, y, z) function.
\param vertices[in] Array of vertices in the polyhedron. Each vertex consists of 3 coordinates, x, y and z, therefore this is an n x 3 array.
\param faces Array (n by 3 by 3) of triangular faces, such that faces[i][j][k] represents the k-coordinate (where x=0, y=1, z= 2) of the j'th vertex of the i'th face
of the polyhedron.
\param x X-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param nx Number of X-coordinates
\param y Y-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param ny Number of Y-coordinates
\param z Z-coordinate values on the grid to be checked.
\param nz Number of Z-coordinates
